libctapimkt for Debian
----------------------

The plain *.[ch] files were submitted via e-mail a long time ago (2008)
by upstream because I promised to write some autotools stuff around this
which was supposed to be published at the download site.  Unfortunately
the later did not happened until now and there is no point in letting
the new code bit-rot on my hard disk.
